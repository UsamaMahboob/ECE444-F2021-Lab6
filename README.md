Pros and Cons of TDD:

Pros:
TDD helps to make the application more modular as you are forced to devise the architecture of the system into smaller modules to perform unit tests. This modularity also makes it easier to maintain the code as well as to scale it. TDD helps ensure quality of the code as every feature of the application has associated test cases to ensure that any bugs encountered can be dealth with sooner rather than later. 

Cons:
Implementing TDD is more complex due to higher need for collaboration and synchronization between the team members as a unit tests could be covering a small part of the feature in a particular way with certain inputs while the other part might be implemented in a different way so it is important to reduce ambiguity by clearly stating out what the test case will cover and what the scope of the test case is. TDD development is also slower as there is a need to develop and maintain numerous test cases for all the different features of the application.
